# guide_brick_detection
guide brick detection based on machine learning and network connection.
## Abstract
This is a part of the senior project "Multifunctional guide stick based on image analysis and network connection." in MEM, NSYSU.

We hope that blind people can walk in the most convinient way. So we design a app with network connecting to computer in home as a client.

## Structure

Once the client take the picture. The server in home can get the picture and analyze which kind of guide bricks based on supervised learning. After the server gets the result. It will send the result back to the client. And the client will make different decisions and sounds to let the blind people know how to do next.
